abstract={We present a systematic study to elucidate the role of triple junctions (TJs) and their constituent grain boundaries on the structural stability of nanocrystalline materials. Using atomistic simulations along with the nudge elastic band calculations, we explored the atomic structural and thermodynamic properties of TJs in three different fcc materials. We found that the magnitude of excess energy at a TJ was directly related to the atomic density of the metal. Further, the vacancy binding and migration energetics in the vicinity of the TJ were examined as they play a crucial role in the structural stability of NC materials. The resolved line tension which takes into account the stress buildup at the TJ was found to be a good measure in predicting the vacancy binding tendency near the TJ. The activation energy for vacancy migration along the TJ was directly correlated with the measured excess energy. Finally, we show that the resistance for vacancy diffusion increased for TJs with larger excess stored energy and the defect mobility at some TJs is slower than their constituent GBs. Hence, our results have general implications on the diffusional process in NC materials and provide new insight into stabilizing NC materials with tailored TJs.},

  abstract  = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as common neighbour analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, polyhedral template matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. common neighbour analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.},

Thus solute segregation to dislocations and vacancies gives rise to a reduction of their formation energies, too.

  abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

The inter-atomic interactions were described by the Lennard–Jones potential. Each simulation cell contained six trijunctions plus the nine associated symmetric tilt grain boundaries. The energy of systems of differing sizes was monitored during annealing and after quenching to obtain quantitative estimates of the excess energy of the grain boundaries and trijunctions. For this system, the total excess energy contributed by the trijunctions was found to be negative.

This paper derives the proportionality constant relating the voxel interaction strength to a boundary energy, derives a formula for the boundary curvature, and uses the Turnbull expression to find the boundary velocity. Providing units of measure for the boundary energy and the boundary curvature allow Monte Carlo simulations and cellular automata simulations, respectively, to be subject to more than one driving force. Using the Turnbull expression to relate a driving pressure to a boundary velocity allows the remaining quantities in cellular automata simulations to be endowed with units of measure. The approach in this paper does not require any calibration of parametric links, but assumes that the voxel interaction strength is a Gaussian function of the distance.

A second EBSD map, obtained after grain growth (with a mean diameter of the grains about twice the initial value) was used for comparisons between the simulations and the experiment. The grain size distribution, the grain boundary character distribution and the crystallographic texture are reproduced rather well with this modified model using a moderate grain size factor effect.

  abstract = {We present the results of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of grain growth in polycrystalline nickel with nanoscale grains. The simulations show that grain growth is accompanied by coherent twin boundary (CTB) generation. As the grains grow, twins collide; such collisions result in twin junctions. We catalog all possible twin junctions and show examples of each from the simulations. These include junctions of 2–4 CTBs with grain boundaries and five-fold twin junctions (penta-twins). We elucidate the mechanisms by which all of these junctions form and their relative frequencies. Penta-twins, which are rare in coarse microstructures, occur frequently in nanocrystalline metals. Their absence in macro-scale samples can be traced to the wedge-disclination character (and, consequently, an elastic energy that diverges with sample size). In the nanocrystalline case, the presence of penta-twins can be traced to this twin collision formation mechanism, which is responsible for their wedge-disclination dipole character (relatively small elastic energy). We demonstrate how all CTB junctions, especially penta-twins, retard grain growth.},

  abstract = {Experiments, theory and atomistic simulations show that finite triple junction mobility results in non-equilibrium triple junction angles in evolving polycrystalline systems. These angles have been predicted and verified for cases where grain boundary migration is steady-state. Yet, steady-state never occurs during the evolution of polycrystalline microstructures as a result of changing grain size and topological events (e.g., grain face/edge switching - “T1” process, or grain disappearance “T2” or “T3” processes). We examine the non-steady evolution of the triple junction angle in the vicinity of topological events and show that large deviations from equilibrium and/or steady-state angles occur. We analyze $∖tau$ the characteristic relaxation time of triple junction angles τ by consideration of a pair of topological events, beginning from steady-state migration. Using numerical results and theoretical analysis we predict how the triple junction angle varies with time and how τ varies with triple junction mobility. We argue that it is precisely those cases where grain boundaries are moving quickly (e.g., topological process in nanocrystalline materials), that the classical steady-state prediction of the triple junction angle about finite triple junction mobility is inapplicable and may only be applied qualitatively.},

  abstract  = {A new method of computing grain boundary energies for arbitrary misorientation and inclination angles has been proposed, based on an atomistic approach (molecular statics) using a semi-empirical atomic potential (2NN MEAM). The procedure was applied to computation of the [110] symmetric tilt boundary energy of pure Al. It is shown that the computed grain boundary energy and especially its misorientation dependence are in good agreement with the information in the experimental literature. The probable sources and amounts of computation error and the applicability to the computation of inter-phase interface boundary energy are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The width and energy of low-index interfacial boundaries (IFBs) in Ni–Ni3Al are calculated using first-principles methods for temperatures ranging from 0 to 1300K. The low-temperature, coherent and chemically sharp (100), (110) and (111) IFBs are studied using conventional spin-polarized density functional methods. Cluster expansion methods, as implemented in the ATAT software suite, are used to estimate the interfacial excess free energies (IEFEs) and composition and long-range order profiles of these defects as a function of temperature. The simple face-centered cubic-based cluster expansion produces interfacial widths in the range of 1.5–3.0nm at 1000K. Interfacial widths double in size with an increase in temperature of 500K. We also find that the IEFEs for the (100), (110) and (111) IFBs are strongly temperature dependent, decreasing by 90% as temperature increases from 0 to 1000K. While vibrational and electronic entropic contributions were also considered, changes in free energy are dominated by the configurational entropy. The predicted high-temperature IEFE is approximately 10mJm−2 which is in excellent agreement with previous fits to experimentally measured coarsening rates.},

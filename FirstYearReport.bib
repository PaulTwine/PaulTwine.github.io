abstract={We present a systematic study to elucidate the role of triple junctions (TJs) and their constituent grain boundaries on the structural stability of nanocrystalline materials. Using atomistic simulations along with the nudge elastic band calculations, we explored the atomic structural and thermodynamic properties of TJs in three different fcc materials. We found that the magnitude of excess energy at a TJ was directly related to the atomic density of the metal. Further, the vacancy binding and migration energetics in the vicinity of the TJ were examined as they play a crucial role in the structural stability of NC materials. The resolved line tension which takes into account the stress buildup at the TJ was found to be a good measure in predicting the vacancy binding tendency near the TJ. The activation energy for vacancy migration along the TJ was directly correlated with the measured excess energy. Finally, we show that the resistance for vacancy diffusion increased for TJs with larger excess stored energy and the defect mobility at some TJs is slower than their constituent GBs. Hence, our results have general implications on the diffusional process in NC materials and provide new insight into stabilizing NC materials with tailored TJs.},

  abstract  = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as common neighbour analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, polyhedral template matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. common neighbour analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.},

Thus solute segregation to dislocations and vacancies gives rise to a reduction of their formation energies, too.

  abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

The inter-atomic interactions were described by the Lennard–Jones potential. Each simulation cell contained six trijunctions plus the nine associated symmetric tilt grain boundaries. The energy of systems of differing sizes was monitored during annealing and after quenching to obtain quantitative estimates of the excess energy of the grain boundaries and trijunctions. For this system, the total excess energy contributed by the trijunctions was found to be negative.

We focus on the atomic structure and formation energy of the triple junctions as a function of the misorientation between the adjacent grains. We find that the triple junctions in graphene consist mostly of five-fold and seven-fold carbon rings.

This paper derives the proportionality constant relating the voxel interaction strength to a boundary energy, derives a formula for the boundary curvature, and uses the Turnbull expression to find the boundary velocity. Providing units of measure for the boundary energy and the boundary curvature allow Monte Carlo simulations and cellular automata simulations, respectively, to be subject to more than one driving force. Using the Turnbull expression to relate a driving pressure to a boundary velocity allows the remaining quantities in cellular automata simulations to be endowed with units of measure. The approach in this paper does not require any calibration of parametric links, but assumes that the voxel interaction strength is a Gaussian function of the distance.

The capabilities of this modified model are checked by comparing several characteristics of the microstructures obtained after various grain growth simulations with experimental data obtained for an IF steel. One large EBSD map, made at the end of the primary recrystallization, is used directly as the initial image for the calculations. A second EBSD map, obtained after grain growth (with a mean diameter of the grains about twice the initial value) was used for comparisons between the simulations and the experiment.
